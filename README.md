# Introducing to using Voice assistant 

This is my source code about voice assistant, I used Python library to make this.

If you want to use my Voice assistant, you must have subprocess, wolframalpha, pyttsx3, tkinter, json, random, operator, speech_recognition, datetime wikipedia, webbrowser, os, winshell, pyjokes, feedparser, smtplib, ctypes, time, requests, shutil library and you must download them via pypip or their website.

When you want to start program, you will run in voice-assistant.exe or Ctrl + Alt + N (in Visual Studio Code) to run this program, you speak in this application and they will respond answer for you.

Thank you for using my program.

Good luck
